## Stereo Vision-Based Approach
Click [here](stereo_vision_based/README.md) for details.

## Wearables
Using lattice iCE40 UltraPlus and caffe CBSR strucutre

## Caffe

* CBSR
* Number output 16 or 64
* Bias term
* TP,FP,TN,FN
* Compare output
* kernel_size


## ICE40UP
* Run on board
* LED show different state
* LED show machine learning result(Important)
* Feed data from csv
* Feed data from sensor

## Tensorflow
* Which structure works
* Restrictions


## Board different
The caffe and tensorflow has different requirement when run on MDP and ICE40 development board

## Paticipant
